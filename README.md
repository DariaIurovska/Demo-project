# PET-project

I've created this project with the purpose to demonstrate how I am proficient in technologies and automated testing tools.
 
 The goal of the project is to test several typical user scenarios on the site of the online clothing store https://cabanchi.com/.

 To run tests in different scenarios, please use the appropriate XML-files.
